# So uh, about this...
Windows isn't the best dev environment, these are some softwares I utilized to make the experience more... tolerable. On top of that, I've included **s m o l** "cheatsheets" so to say on each one, maybe, idk yet man. Hopefully this can be a replacement to having to go to various wikis 900 times a day...

# Cmder
## Getting Started
As I understand it, `cmder` is pretty bulky, as an alternative, `ConEmu` might be a better for you. They also have a lighter ~8.5MB option. If you don't download the FULL version first, I rec skipping down to the bit on `Spoon`

## Cheatsheet
Here's some keyboard shortcuts as copied from their github. Personal fav is *Ctrl + Alt + u* to traverse up directory.
### Tab manipulation
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> : New tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?)
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> : Close tab
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> : Close tab (if pressed on empty command)
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Fast new tab: <kbd>1</kbd> - CMD, <kbd>2</kbd> - PowerShell
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to next tab
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to previous tab
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Switch to tab #Number
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Fullscreen
### Shell
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!)
* <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> : Traversing text with as usual on Windows
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> : History search
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Mouse : Select and copy text from buffer

## Additional Tips
### Setting cmder startup directory
I'm not sure if this is universal, but my startup directory was setup to be `%cmder_root%`. If you open up *Cmder -> Settings -> Tasks -> select {cmd::Cmder} (or similar)* you should find a button *Startup dir...* which you can change. There are [manual ways](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/57) to do this.

# PuTTY
This is another terminal emulator, it's the one the use at *The Hartford* so by connection I've learned about it. You can download it [here](https://www.putty.org). 
## Some basic cheats
**Copy/Paste:** simply left click and *drag* over what you want to copy, then right click if you want to paste w/i `PuTTY`. If you're wanting to share some trash error w/ your coworker or whatever just do the standard  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>

# tmux


# Spoon
Look I might be stright up stealing from [here](https://medium.com/@pranjalpaliwal/perfect-dev-environment-on-windows-the-easiest-way-691c649850eb) so I don't have the whole shebang up and running.
